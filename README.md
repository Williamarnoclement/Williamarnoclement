Hello world ðŸ‘‹ Bonjour tout le monde

My name is William CLEMENT. Iâ€™m a developer interested in computer graphics, arts and technologies.

My only dream is to create the sofware that will enable artists to fulfil their vision.

### My work

On my Github profile, you'll find some of my productions. There are a lot of projects: a 3D animation software written in JAVA, an opensource software directory written in PHP Vanilla, and much more !
